# interpretable-fc-modeling
 This repository contains code and resources for uncovering functional connectivity (FC) patterns predictive of behavioral traits using interpretable machine learning models. The project aims to enhance the generalizability and interpretability of BWAS by learning fine-grained FC patterns at both regional and participant levels.
